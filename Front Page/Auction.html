    <h1>Types of Auctions</h1>

    <h2>1. English Auction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The most common auction format where participants bid openly against one another.</li>
      <li>The auctioneer raises the price until no higher bids are made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="source">Source: Cramton, P. (1998). "Ascending Auctions." The Journal of Economic Perspectives.</p>
    <p>
      The term "auction" commonly refers to the "English style auction," characterized by ascending bids and the
      phrase "going, going, gone." However, this is not the only or most efficient auction method. Economic historian
      Ralph Cassady highlights alternative auction styles, such as the Dutch descending-bid and Japanese simultaneous-bid
      systems, which reflect historical and cultural influences on auction practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, England used various methods like silent paper bids and the candle auction, as well as unique
      approaches like "mineing," where bidding ended when a participant shouted "Mine!" Despite these options, the
      English auction style became dominant due to its public, competitive, and overtly manipulated nature.

    <h2>2. Dutch Auction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The auctioneer starts with a high price and lowers it until a bidder accepts the current price.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="source">Source: Kwasnica, A. M., & H. M. (2009). "The Dutch Auction: A New Approach to Selling." Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization.</p>
    <p>
      In a Dutch auction, an item starts at a maximum price that decreases over time until a bid is placed. Bidders must
      balance the certainty of securing the item with the potential for a lower price, creating a strategic decision-making
      scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Researchers developed a computerized Dutch auction platform to study this dynamic, conducting experiments that varied
      the number of items and the rate of price reduction. In their study involving 66 participants, they found no significant
      effects from these variations on bidding behavior. They proposed a new adaptation of prospect theory to explain group
      bidding behavior, which considers the trade-off between certainty and expected utility.

    <h2>3. Sealed Bid Auction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bidders submit written bids without knowing others' offers; the highest bid wins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="source">Source: Milgrom, P., & Weber, R. J. (1982). "A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding." Econometrica.</p>
    <p>
      A sealed-bid auction is a bidding process where all participants submit their bids simultaneously in sealed envelopes,
      preventing bidders from knowing each other's offers. The term "sealed bid" indicates that the bids remain confidential
      until they are opened on a specified date. The highest bid is typically declared the winner of the auction.
